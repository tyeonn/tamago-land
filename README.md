### Background
http://www.donkey-kong.org/ 
Tamago Land is a variation of the classic game of Donkey Kong. The original Donkey Kong is a single player game where Mario has to climb ladders to reach the top to save Princess Peach. Donkey Kong is the antagonist that throws barrels down in order to thwart Mario from reaching the top. In Tamago Land, the player plays as a penguin that has to eat all the fish and climb ladders to navigate through the floors.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project is implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic,
- `Canvas` for game rendering,
- `Webpack` to bundle js files.

There are six scripts involved in this project:

`index.js`: this script handles the logic for creating and updating the necessary elements and rendering them to the DOM.
`map.js`: this script loads all the elements for the map.
`player.js`: this script handles player movement and interaction with the map.
`fish.js`: this script handles the fish animation.
`sprite.js`: this script handles the animation of the sprite sheet.
`enemy.js`: this script handles enemy movement.



### Bonus features
